# Advent of code 2022

This is my try at advent of code 2022, done in 2023 (Yeah, I am a bit late)

The purpose of this is to both train coding and code a bit in C

_Disclaimer_: I know there are a lot of vulneravilities that can make the code crash, I decided to ignore them because I know how the input files look like
